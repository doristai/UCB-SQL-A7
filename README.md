## Summary

63-64% of the current workforce are either retired or eligible for mentorship programme which those positions need to be filled within the next 5-10 years. Issues can still be raised even if those vaccancies can be filled immmediately. For instance, newly hired employees might lack of experiences which requires extra time for training. The company should  build up long-lasting employmentship with their employees to avoid high turnover rate of each positions. Also, the HR should hire new employees with relevant experiences in each position. However, rapid development of automation and technologies can overcome the problems with lack in workforce which can ensure a company to function stably in the future to maintain its revenues.
